# Estimate-bangalore-house-prices
A machine learning model that predicts the price of a house based on numerous factors.
The provided Jupyter notebook outlines a project to predict home prices in Bangalore. Here's a summary of its contents:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load the dataset using Pandas.
Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze the data distribution and relationships using visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots).
Identify and remove outliers to improve model performance.
Model Building:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a linear regression model to predict home prices.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Model Testing:

Test the model with various inputs to predict home prices for different locations and property features.
Example predictions include home prices for different locations, square footage, number of bathrooms, and bedrooms.
Model Exporting:

Save the trained model using pickle for future use.
Export the column information to a JSON file, which will be useful for the prediction application.
Code Execution Examples:

Provide examples of how to use the model to predict home prices for specific inputs.
The notebook is well-structured, starting with data loading and preprocessing, followed by EDA, model building, testing, and finally exporting the model for deployment.
